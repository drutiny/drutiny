  Large static assets should ideally be housed in other services, e.g.
  Amazon S3 (for files) or Youtube (for videos).
remediation: |
  Either delete the files if they are not needed, or look to house them in a
  more appropriate location. Note, all the above large public files have a
  public URL and can be downloaded, ensure you do not have any sensitive
  information in there.
