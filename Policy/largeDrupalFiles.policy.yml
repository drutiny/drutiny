description: |
  Large static assets should be optimized for online display or ideally be housed in other services, e.g.
    Amazon S3 (for files) or Youtube (for videos). Storing large files can consume storage volumes,
    increase page load time and contribute to a higher than desired cache eviction rate.

    This policy identifies files managed by Drupal that are larger than {{readable_max_size}}.
remediation: |
  Either delete the files if they are not needed, compress or optimize them,
  or look to house them in a more appropriate location.success: No database updates required.
success: No large files found.
