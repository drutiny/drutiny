# Writting Checks for Drutiny

Drutiny is extensible. If it does't support the type of check you want to run
you can simply add one. Drutiny is an "outside-in" style site auditor which
means you're not constrained to a single runtime environment such drush, Drupal
Console, PHPUnit or Behat. All of these and more can be used with Drutiny to
construct a comprehensive audit of your site.

## Getting Started
A Drutiny check consists of two files.

* A `YAML` file that informs Drutiny of the check and provides to variables and
content for the check
* A PHP class the executes the check and remediation if applicable.

Drutiny comes with a scaffolding command to pre-generate these files for you:

```bash
$ ./bin/drutiny check:generate
What is the title of your check? No llamas allowed
Please provide a machine name for your check? llamas.deny
Does this check support auto-remediation? (y/n) y
Created src/Check/llamas.deny.yml
Created src/Check/NoLlamasAllowed.php
```

`llamas.deny` will now be listed in `./bin/drutiny check:list` and you can run it
using `./bin/drutiny check:run llamas.deny <target>`.

If you move your PHP file to a more appropriate sub-location, be sure to update
its namespace in both the PHP file and in the yaml file.

## Writing the Check
Checks are done by calling the `check` method within the check's PHP class. In
the example above, this PHP class can be located at `src/Check/NoLlamasAllowed.php`.

The check method should return `TRUE` if the check passes successfully or `FALSE`
if the check fails. If the check encounters a failure or exception which does not
allow the check to determine if the site state is correct, then an `Exception`
of any type can be thrown.

```php
/**
 * @inheritDoc
 */
public function check(Sandbox $sandbox) {
  throw new \Exception("How does one ensure llamas are denied?");
}
```

## The Sandbox
The Sandbox object passed to the check method contains access to drivers you
may use in your check such as `drush`.

```php
/**
 * @inheritDoc
 */
public function check(Sandbox $sandbox) {
  // Use drush to confirm Drupal settings deny llamas.
  $config = $sandbox->drush(['format' => 'json'])
                    ->configGet('llamas.settings', 'allowed');
  $denied = $config['llamas.settings:allowed'] == FALSE;

  // Confirm llamas have not accessed the site.
  $lama_access = $sandbox->exec('grep llamas /var/log/apache/access.log | grep -v 403');

  return $denied && empty($lama_access);
}
```

## Remediation
Remediation is both an optional choice to execute when running a check or profile
but it is also optional for the check to implement. Remediable checks implement
`Drutiny\Check\RemediableInterface`.

If a check fails and remediation is enabled, then the `remediate` method is
called which attempts the remediation and then returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` as to if
the remediation was successful or not. In most cases, recalling the `check`
method from within the remediation is the best approach.

```php
/**
 * @inheritDoc
 */
public function remediate(Sandbox $sandbox) {
  // This calls: drush config-set -y llamas.settings allowed 0
  $sandbox->drush()->configSet('-y', 'llamas.settings', 'allowed', 0);

  // Re-check now the config should have changed.
  return $this->check($sandbox);
}
```

## Parameters
Parameters allow you to configure the check based on the runtime environment.
For example, the page cache check contains parameters to allow you to audit
what the page cache `max_age` setting should be.

Parameters are defined in the check's yaml and can be used in the `check` and `remediation` methods.

```yaml
parameters:
  foo:
    type: string
    description: "A measure of foo to apply to denied llamas"
    default: bar
```

```php
/**
 * @inheritDoc
 */
public function check(Sandbox $sandbox) {
  $foo = $sandbox->getParameter('foo');

  $config = $sandbox->drush(['format' => 'json'])
                    ->configGet('llamas.settings', 'foo');
  $this->setParameter('actual_foo', $config['llamas.settings:foo']);
  return $foo == $config['llamas.settings:foo'];
}
```

Parameters can be used to render the output of the success, failure and
remediation messages returned for the check.

```yaml
success: |
  Lama settings ensure no llamas will have access with a foo measure of {{actual_foo}}
failure: |
  Llamas have free reign on the site! foo measure set to {{actual_foo}}
remediation: |
  Set `llamas.settings:foo` to "bar" to better manage llamas.
```

When rendered, the success message would say something like this:

> Lama settings ensure no llamas will have access with a foo measure of bar

**Note**: message parameters in yaml support markdown syntax which is rendered
into HTML for the HTML reports.
