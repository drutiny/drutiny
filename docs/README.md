A generic Drupal site auditing and optional remediation tool.

## Installation

This repository is a baseline framework and not recommended to install by itself
unless you're planning on building your own auditing tool based on top of Drutiny.

You can install Drutiny into your project with [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

    composer require drutiny/drutiny ^3.6.0

Drutiny has native target support for Git and [Drush](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/).
If you wish to use these types of targets, you must install the underlying software.


## Usage

Drutiny is a command line tool that can be called from the composer vendor bin directory:

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny

### Finding targets to audit

Drutiny has a number of connectors that allow you to discover and access "Targets"
to audit. Use the `target:sources` command to learn which sources are available.

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny target:sources

When supported by the target source, use the `target:list` command to list all
the available targets from a given source:

    # List all available targets through DDEV.
    ./vendor/bin/drutiny target:list ddev

### Finding policies available to run

Drutiny comes with a `policy:list` command that lists all the policies available to audit against.

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny policy:list

Policies provided by other packages such as [drutiny/plugin-distro-common](https://github.com/drutiny/plugin-distro-common) will also appear here, if they are installed.

### Installing Drutiny Plugins

Additional Drutiny policies, audits, profiles and commands can be installed with composer.

    $ composer search drutiny

Official Drutiny plugins include:

-   [Acquia](https://github.com/drutiny/plugin-acquia)
-   [Pantheon](https://github.com/drutiny/plugin-pantheon)
-   [Sumologic](https://github.com/drutiny/sumologic)
-   [Cloudflare](https://github.com/drutiny/cloudflare)
-   [CodeClimate Engine](https://github.com/drutiny/codeclimate)
-   [jUnit](https://github.com/drutiny/junit)
-   [Domo](https://github.com/drutiny/domo)

Inside Drutiny core (this repository) is native support for Drush, DDEV, Lando and
Docksal.

### Running an Audit

An audit of a single policy can be run against a site by using `policy:audit` and passing the policy name and site target:

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny policy:audit Drupal-8:PageCacheExpiry @drupalvm.dev

The command above would audit the site that resolved to the `@drupalvm.dev` drush alias against the `Drupal-8:PageCacheExpiry` policy.

Some policies have parameters you can specify which can be passed in at call time. Use `policy:info` to find out more about the parameters available for a check.

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny policy:audit -p value=600 Drupal-8:PageCacheExpiry @drupalvm.dev

Audits are self-contained classes that are simple to read and understand. Policies are simple YAML files that determine how to use Audit classes. Therefore, Drutiny can be extended very easily to audit for your own unique requirements. Pull requests are welcome as well, please see the [contributing guide](https://drutiny.github.io/2.3.x/CONTRIBUTING/).

### Running a profile of checks

A site audit is running a collection of checks that make up a profile. This allows you to audit against a specific standard, policy or best practice. Drutiny comes with some base profiles which you can find using `profile:list`. You can run a profile with `profile:run` in a simlar format to `policy:audit`.

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny profile:run d8 @drupalvm.dev

Parameters can not be passed in at runtime for profiles but are instead predefined by the profile itself.

## Getting help

Because this is a Symfony Console application, you have some other familiar commands:

    ./vendor/bin/drutiny help profile:run

In particular, if you use the `-vvv` argument, then you will see all the drush commands, and SSH commands printed to the screen.
