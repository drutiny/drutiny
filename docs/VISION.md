# Drutiny vision

The main goals and vision for Drutiny:

* Be extensible
* Not require any "special sauce" in order to run
* Not force someone else's _best practice_ down your throat, but instead allow you to create you own best practice, that is unique to you, your company and the sites you look after
* Be able to quickly audit anything from 1 to many sites, and each site ideally take 30 seconds or less to audit
* Produce reports in different formats to adapt into other systems
