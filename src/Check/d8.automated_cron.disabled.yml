title: Automated Cron module is disabled
class: \Drutiny\Check\D8\ModuleDisabled
description: |
  The automated cron module will hijack page requests in order to run cron.
  This has a performance impact for end users who are unlucky being burdened
  with the task without consent and unknowingly.
remediation: |
  Disable the automated cron module and ensure cron is run via a system cron
  process such as `crontab` and using a non-web process such as drush.
success: Automated Cron is disabled.
failure: Automated Cron is enabled.
parameters:
  module:
    default: automated_cron
