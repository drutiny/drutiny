  Kint for PHP is a tool designed to present your debugging data in the
  absolutely best way possible.
  In other words, it's var_dump() and debug_backtrace() on steroids.
  Easy to use, but powerful and customizable. An essential addition to your
  development toolbox. Should not be used in production.
